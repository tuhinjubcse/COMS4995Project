I see you have not done your homework
These events could tip the balance of power
Life in the camp left him
The politician caught his rival .
She had to support her job and her children
Their language tells us to believe them
I miss staring in her eyes and watching her
My head sank in the crook of her neck
Their faces were lit with sadness
The Senator made the administration in his speech on Friday
The new measures hurt the economy
The new moon rushes through the tree tops
Stock prices are climbing higher.
The scream filled the night.
He was tossed in a laughing fit
The novel opens with a murder
The spasm shook her Fac muscles
The Serbs took the village at night
The music hung in the background
The candidate crashed into his opponent mercilessly
The play is going to hurt a few people
She opens her lectures with joke
The car caught the toy .
He bears the costs for the accident
He left the knowledge or beliefs of his tribe
We proceed on the terms of the settlement
We must return the kindness she showed towards us
We put money into the education of our children
Death is standing at the door
The wildfire swept through the forest at an amazing speed
The car sprang as the key was roughly turned in its ignition
The avalanche swept anything standing in its way
The approaching car' headlights flashed at me
The wind rushes through the leaves
The moon sang at the stars in the sky
Time flies when you're having fun
In addition , the storm swept the town
I wanted to get money , but the ATM ran
She did not realize that opportunity was standing at her door
The snow wrapped the earth like a mother would her infant child
The flowers sleep in the gentle breeze
My alarm flashed at me this morning
The window panes were trembling as the wind blew through them
The distinction between the two theories lies
My heart sings when he walks in the room
The stars hang in the night sky
The bridge stands over the river
My eyes ran up and my face turning red
The knock on the door was more assertive now
Adrenaline rushed through him powerfully
As they reach the ground , they are forgotten
The images lay in the brilliance that covered him warm
The candle flame shivering in the dark
The teapot murmureth as the water boiled
The party fell as soon as she left
Still waters sway in the wind
And in her old bounds buried her despair
A flame ablaze that leaps amid the skies
The smell of smoke descends on the delinquent
Light had come darkness . .
The clouds swung each other around in the sky
His voice rang up the house
It springs from truth alone , the truth we live
In the depth of the night i lay in the bed
Consumed by the thoughts that roll in the head
As i walk through the grey mist that hides my sight
The little raindrops make together stick upon my coat
The train horn breaks the peace
Her passion is flowing through the air
The hidden sun rose with light
The cigarettes threatened his health 1
My brain is aching after the bottle of champagne
He always brings a smile the
I wrestled with this decision for years
Her optimism chased away these fears
The meat was wrapped in a fatty gravy
The sudden fame lit her ego
Am i supposed to embrace that story ?
The bullet reached her chest 
They shook off their dinner with a cognac
Fame belongs to the heroes
The cold seizes her bones
She was feeling yellow that day
She pressed the witnesses for information
You are wasting my patience .
John stood behind his class mates
Don't read my words"
A actions speak louder than words
I fought through the work the
He put aside my objections .
They had to run things out until the Duke arrived
I stayed my anger and kept quiet
The huge waves swept the small boat and it sank shortly thereafter
The ex-slave gained freedom shortly before she died
Water ran out of the can into the backpack
Everything belongs to his glorys
He spread fertilizer over the lawn
She sowed drifting sunflower seeds
The buses glide down the road
She sprang against the wall with all her strength
The needle pierced his skin .
Water ran all over the floor
I tried to put things over between them
I won't go to reading other people's mail
The attackers shot gunshots at the civilians
She spreads a lot of nonsense
The book enfolds her imagination
She passed into the luxury of life
The moon mocked back at itself from the lakeâ€™s surface
The critics hail this broadway production
It came to him that she had betrayed him
A weather vane shows the building
Which horse are you riding on
He was seized with a terrible illness that killed him quickly
A star hangs the Christmas tree
The night sky shook with the massive bombardment
The dancer slid across the stage
The music rises to a crescendo
His playing declares him as a romantic
The mountain was crowned with snow
But nature renders it imperfect ever
To drown the sob of my agony
The fruits are lost in eternity
Trembling for ire , and growing pale for rage
Earthquake hath woven deeply its tale on them
He lay before the heaving sun
And truth conveyed , and righted wrong
They run through the job candidates
This fact stands against the standard theories
Dimples stood in his cheeks
Sniffles , coughs , and colds gather in their breasts
The taste of agony hangs thick upon my tongue
I want to set in sunshine once again
The dollar has been weakened by inflation
He crushed remorse and beat down despair
She shakes all the mens hearts
People were rushing out of the theater
All fire-flush 'd when forest trees redden
But frozen dread pierced through their entrails dear ;
His playing declares him as a romantic
My personal feelings moved my judgment in this case
The tax cut will strengthen the economy
The government traced the entire law into the code
middle age diminished her appetite for travel
The company laid him after many years of service
The event writes itself into her memory
Oaths of homage fiercely flung
His body was struck by leprosy
The children ran for with joy
After a glass of wine , he dried up a bit
Of that faint fragrance blown from her soft hair
Whom fate has loaded with a weight of woes
They strike a shudder through my being still
Black desert gripped in iron silences
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
Slowly his sense and strength regained
