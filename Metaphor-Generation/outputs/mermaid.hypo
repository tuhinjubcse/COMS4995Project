I see you have not done your homework
These events could tip the balance of power
Life in the camp wore him
The politician drove his rival
She had to support her job and her children
Their language tells us to believe them
I miss staring in her eyes and watching her
My head sunk in the crook of her neck
Their faces were filled with sadness
The senator urged the administration in his speech on Friday
The new measures hurt the economy
The new moon rushes through the tree tops
Stock prices are climbing higher
The scream pierced the night
He was tossed in a laughing fit
The novel opens with a murder
The spasm shook her facial muscles
The Serbs took the village at night
The music swirled in the background
The candidate plunged into his opponent mercilessly
The play is going to hit few people
She closes her lectures with joke
The car caught the toy
He bears the costs for the accident
He left the knowledge or beliefs of his tribe
We dwell on the terms of the settlement
We must return the kindness she showed towards us
We put money into the education of our children
Death is standing at the door
The wildfire danced through the forest at an amazing speed
The car sprang as the key was roughly turned in its ignition
The avalanche seized anything standing in its way
The approaching cars headlights smiled at me
The wind rushes through the leaves
The moon sang at the stars in the sky
Time flies when you're having fun
In addition , the storm swept the town
I wanted to get money , but the ATM gave
She did not realize that opportunity was standing at her door
The snow folded the earth like a mother would her infant child
The flowers sleep in the gentle breeze
My alarm blazed at me this morning
The window panes were trembling as the wind blew through them
The distinction between the two theories fades
My heart jumps when he walks in the room
The stars hang in the night sky
The bridge leads over the river
My eyes ran up and i could feel my face turning red
The knock on the door was more assertive now
Adrenaline rushed through him powerfully
As they gain the ground ,They are forgotten
The images lived in the brilliance that covered him warm
The candle flame shivered in the dark
The teapot whispered as the water boiled
The party fell as soon as she left
Still waters wandering in the wind
And in her old bounds buried her despair
A flame ablaze that leaps amid the skies
The smell of smoke descends on the delinquent
Light had broken darkness ; and
The clouds wound each other around in the sky
His voice shook up the house
It sprung from truth alone , the truth we live
In the depth of the night i sank in the bed
Consumed by the thoughts that roll in the head
As i walk through the grey mist that hides my sight
The little raindrops set together stick upon my coat
The train horn proclaims the peace
Her passion is bursting through the air
The hidden sun came with light
The cigarettes harmed his health .
My brain is wandering after the bottle of champagne
He always brings a smile
I wrestled with this decision for years
Her optimism chased away these worries
The meat was wrapped in a fatty gravy
The sudden fame lit her ego
Am i supposed to embrace that story?
The bullet tore her chest .
They polished off their dinner with a cognac
Fame pays to the heroes
The cold settle her bones ,
She was burning yellow that day
She pressed the witnesses for information
You are driving my patience .
John fell behind his class mates
Don't turn my words"
Actions speak louder than words
I burned through the work .
He swept aside my objections .
They had to deal things out until the Duke arrived
I stayed my anger and kept quiet
The huge waves swept the small boat and it sank shortly thereafter
The ex-slave gained freedom shortly before she died
Water ran out of the can into the backpack
Everything adds to his glory
He scattered fertilizer over the lawn
She scattered sunflower seeds
The bus smoked down the road
She sprang against the wall with all her strength
The needle pierced his skin
Water ran all over the floor
I tried to smooth things over between them
I won't take to reading other people're mail
The attackers hurledshots at the civilians
She spreads a lot of nonsense
The book attracted her imagination
She passed into the luxury of Life
The moon gazed back at itself from the lakeâ€™s surface
The critics hailed this broadway production
It came to him that she had betrayed him
A weather vane embraced the building
Which horse are you fixed on
He was seized with a terrible illness that killed him quickly
A star attends the Christmas tree
The night sky shook with the massive bombardment
The dancer slid across the stage
The music rises to a crescendo
His playing showed him as a romantic
The mountain was crowned with snow
But nature renders it imperfect ever
To drown the sob of my agony
The fruits are lost in eternity
Trembling for ire , and growing pale for rage
Earthquake hath woven deeply its tale on them
He lay before the heaving sun
And truth prevailed , and righted wrong
They run through the job candidates
This fact stands against the standard theories
Dimples stood in his cheeks
Sniffles , coughs , and colds gather in their breasts
The taste of agony hangs thick upon my tongue
I want to set in sunshine once again
The dollar has been weakened by inflation
He crushed remorse and beat down despair
She shakes all the men's hearts
People were darting out of the theater
All fire-flush 'd when forest trees redden
But frozen dread pierced through their entrails dear ;
His playing marked him as a romantic
My personal thoughts compel my judgment in this case
The tax cut will stimulate the economy
The government distilled the entire law towards a code
Middle age cooled her appetite for travel
The company dismissed him after many years of service
The event woven itself into her memory
Oaths of homage fiercely flung
His body was subdued by leprosy
The children lit with joy .
After a glass of wine , he loosened up a bit
Of that faint fragrance blown from her soft hair
Whom fate has loaded with a weight of woes
They strike a shudder through my being still
Black desert gripped in iron silences
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
Slowly his sense and strength regained
